/*
Loops
        Refer to page 18-20 on copy

It is not mandatory to write an initialization, condition, or update statement in a loop because loops can be used in various ways, 
such as:
1. Infinite loops: A loop with no condition, used for tasks that need to run indefinitely
    syntax: 
    while (true) {
    // code

2. Loop with initialization and update outside: The initialization and update statements can be outside the loop.

int i = 0;
while (i < 10) {    
    // code
    i++;
}

3. Loop with condition only: A loop with only a condition, used when the initialization and update are not needed.


int i = 0;
while (i < 10) {
    // code
}


However, it's generally good practice to include all three components (initialization, condition, and update) 
in a loop to make the code clear and avoid potentialÂ errors.
